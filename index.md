My name is Matthew Builes, I am an undergraduate computer science and math student at UT Austin interested in getting into ML research. I am a second generation immigrant from Colombia, and I like to visit often to keep up with my family and practice my Spanish. In my free time, I love to read old books, go to the gym, and build things.
