My name is Matthew Builes, I am an undergraduate computer science and math student at UT Austin interested in getting into ML research. I am a second generation immigrant from Colombia who grew up in Houston, and I am the youngest of four siblings. In my free time, I love to read classical literature, go to the gym, and build things.
